# Anchored-wire-meshes

## Introduction
This code is the implementation of the meta-model introduced in Boschi et al. (2023) for analysing the response of anchored wire meshes.
The model was conceived on the basis of finite element results and validated on experimental tests.

## Model assumptions

## Input parameters
The input parameters refers to the geometry and soil/wire mesh mechanical properties. 
The input parameters are named as it followed in the provided Python code:





The differential equations are integrated by using an explicit scheme: stability of the numerical scheme depends on the number of steps.
